+ **Challenge Dip** is a fun website for playing **Voice Challenge** with friends. The website uses contents mostly from __Youtube__.

+ This repository consists of **Automation Test Cases** for [**Challenge Dip**](https://challengedip.com/) created using __Selenium Webdriver__ in **Python** (version 2.7).

Do take a look at our [**Website**](https://challengedip.com/) and provide your **valuable feedback** ~~if possible~~

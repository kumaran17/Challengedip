This file consists of few details regarding the code from the repository Challengedip.

Screenshots are programmed to be saved on my :C:\Users\dhamilton\Desktop\Selenium project\output" with separate sub folders corresponding to each functionality on the website.

I have made use of datetime module to save screenshots on folders with current date and time as its name. This makes it easier for reviewing output.

save_dir = 'C:\\Users\\dhamilton\\Desktop\\Selenium project\\output\\login\\'+datetime.now() .strftime("%d-%m-%Y %I-%M %p")

From the above line of code it can be seen that "+datetime.now()" is used to get current date and time from the system and the datetime format is specified using the code ".strftime("%d-%m-%Y %I-%M %p")" where,

new directory is created using the code "os.mkdir(save_dir)"

since there are several test cases and and the need to save them all within the same directory, the following code is used for every test case that needs to save screenshot

" os.path.join(Login.save_dir, 'screenshotname.png') "

each class has its own separete sub folder to save screenshot which can be seen within them. "os.path.join" joins the location path from ".save_dir" with "screenshot.png" so that the screenshot is saved in the location of save_dir.
